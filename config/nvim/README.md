# Pete's Neovim Config

I've spent way too much time tuning and tweaking my Neovim setup, and this is
the result.

I keep the UI much more minimal than a normal IDE. I'm easily distracted, so I
want my code front-and-centre with not too much other information.

But I also like modern tools for navigating and editing code, like languagge
servers and treesitter.

And it must be fast. Startup time is less than 100 ms.
