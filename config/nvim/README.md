# Pete's Neovim Config

I've spent way too much time tuning and tweaking my Neovim setup, and this is
the result.

I keep the UI much more minimal than a normal IDE. I'm easily distracted, so I
want my code front-and-centre with not too much other information.

But I also like modern tools for navigating and editing code, like languagge
servers and treesitter.

Highlights of this config are:

- Plugin management with lazy.nvim
- Completion with blink.cmp
- Syntax highlighting with nvim-treesitter
- File explorer with oil.nvim
- Fuzzy finding of all sorts of things with Telescope
- Language server support with nvim-lspconfig
- Auto-formatting with none-ls
- Automatic installation of language servers and formatters with mason.nvim
