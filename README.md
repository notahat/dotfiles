# Pete's dotfiles

This does 80% of the work of setting up a Mac the way I like it:

```sh
xcode-select --install
git clone git://github.com/notahat/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
export DOTFILES_ENV=home
./install
```

I re-run `./install` frequently (it's idempotent), which ensures I maintain it.

I remove anything I'm not using to keep it simple.

## What's Installed?

A whole bunch of things, but key components are:

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io). I've got a [pretty fancy setup](config/nvim).
  It's got lots of IDE features, but is a lot cleaner than an IDE. It's well
  commented. It starts up in less than 100ms.
- [Zed](https://zed.dev).
- [Zsh](https://zsh.org). I like it fast (so none of this [Oh My
  Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) nonsense), but with a nice prompt and completion. It
  starts up in about 100ms.
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org).
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installs anything where I always want the latest
  version, including apps from the Mac App Store.
- [Mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) manages things like languages, where I
  want particular versions installed.

## How It Works

`./install` runs steps from the `steps` directory. You can run individual
steps, or the whole set. See `./install -h` for usage.

All my config files live under `config`. These get soft-linked into place by
the steps.

The `environments` directory contains separate `Brewfile`s and `mise.toml`
files for my home and work machines.
